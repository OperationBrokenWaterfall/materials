Fall, 2018

### Introduction
Thank you for agreeing to do this usability test for our application, Quest.  Our application is a product of CS262 software engineering at Calvin College, and we would like to see first-hand what it’s like for real people to use our application.

Be reminded, we’re testing our application, not you.  You can’t do anything wrong.  Don’t hold back your thoughts we value an honest opinion of our application.  Don’t worry about hurting our feelings.  Understanding our users’ thoughts will only help us in the long run to produce a better product.

For the test, we’ll ask you to do certain tasks and we’d like you to think out loud while you’re doing them.  If you have questions, just ask.  If you have comments go ahead and say them.  We’ll record your comments, but won’t make them public.  If, for any reason you would like to quit this test, then just say so. 


### Background Questions
We presume that you’re a CS 108 student who uses technology and your phone often.  
  - Do you have an Android phone?
  - Have you taken part in any scavenger hunts in your time at Calvin?
  -	Before we begin, do you have any questions for us?

### The Test
1. Open Quest - What is your initial reaction to the homepage? Is it clear what you need to input on this page, what what it is for?
2. General Tasks - We'll ask you to do some of the following tasks, depending upon how much time we have together.
    * Find the three main pages of the application.  Is it clear to you what the purpose of each page is?
    * Find the images of the locations within the scavenger hunt.  Do you have any idea where these pictures are from?
    * Find your teams current score.
    * There are several test hunt locations within this room.  Find them and score points for yourself.

### Thanks
Thank you for your willingness to help us test out our application.  The Quest application is still being prototyped and is far from complete.  Your feedback and thoughts will help us immensely as we move forward and hope to make out application bug free and user friendly.

We’ll contact you soon with a summary of what we have discovered through our user tests and how we hope to improve our application based on your responses. Thanks!
