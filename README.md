# Quest
CS262 Team Application

## Project Vision —

Team DragonsBreath hopes to create a fun app targeted at Freshman and CS 108 students who are unfamiliar with Calvin's campus. The end goal is to create an Android based scavenger hunt called Quest. Quest will include features such as leader boards, team creation, open-world exploration, realistic graphics, and full immersion. The goal is to give CS108 students a fun way to bond and learn more about Calvin's campus.

Quest, at its completion, will have a library of images taken from around Calvin and a form of verificationa associated with each image. This will most likely take the form of a QR code, gps verification, or something similar. Upon finding a location, the player will use their phone to scan and earn points. These points will be tracked and displayed for all users to see. Users will also be able to link up and make teams to pool their points against other teams.

## N+1 Architectural Views — 
This section provides a variety of views of the system architecture, based on what the Unified Process calls a Software Architecture Document (SAD). This semester, we'll set N=4 by including the following views:

User View (the +1 view)
Logical View
Data View
Interface View
Deployment View
Each section should summarizes the key architectural decisions documented in that view and explain why they were made.

## Supplemental Specifications — 
  URPS Non Functional Requirements:
  - The application should be built using Java-Android-Native.
  - The application should implement a relational database.
  - The application should perform its functions efficiently should not take longer than a few seconds to perform its     functions(Efficient).
  - All Android phone users should be able to run our application(accessible).
  - The application should run without crashing and should be free of bugs(Reliable).
  - A user to should be able to figure out how to use our application in under 5 minutes.  
  - The application should be testable to determine if it accomplishes what it intends.  

## Test Suite — 
This test suite specifies how you will test your system and reports on how the testing went, including: Unit testing of your system modules (at levels 0 and 1) (if required by the instructor) System testing of your system functions (at levels 1 and 2) Usability testing Presentation Materials — This section includes the presentation materials for your two team presentations.

## The System — 
This section should allow a user to get a copy of your system (or system prototype), including on-line documentation, and install it in their own environment.
