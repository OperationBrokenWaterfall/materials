# Quest
CS262 Team Application

## Project Vision —

Team DragonsBreath hopes to create a fun app targeted at Freshman and CS 108 students who are unfamiliar with Calvin's campus. The end goal is to create an Android based scavenger hunt called Quest. Quest will include features such as leader boards, team creation, open-world exploration, realistic graphics, and full immersion. The goal is to give CS108 students a fun way to bond and learn more about Calvin's campus.

Quest, at its completion, will have a library of images taken from around Calvin and a form of verificationa associated with each image. This will most likely take the form of a QR code, gps verification, or something similar. Upon finding a location, the player will use their phone to scan and earn points. These points will be tracked and displayed for all users to see. Users will also be able to link up and make teams to pool their points against other teams.

## N+1 Architectural Views — 
This section provides a variety of views of the system architecture, based on what the Unified Process calls a Software Architecture Document (SAD). This semester, we'll set N=4 by including the following views:

User View (the +1 view)
[Class Diagram](https://github.com/OperationBrokenWaterfall/materials/blob/master/UMLClassDiagram_QUEST.pdf)
[Data View]()
[Interface View](https://github.com/OperationBrokenWaterfall/materials/blob/master/userInterfaceModel.png)
[Deployment View](https://github.com/OperationBrokenWaterfall/materials/blob/master/QuestDeploymentDiagram.pdf)
Each section should summarizes the key architectural decisions documented in that view and explain why they were made.

## Supplemental Specifications — 
  URPS Non Functional Requirements:
  - The application should be built using Java-Android-Native.
  - The application should implement a relational database.
  - The application should perform its functions efficiently and should not take longer than 3 seconds to perform its functions.
  - All Android phone users should be able to run our application.
  - The application should run without crashing and should be free of bugs.
  - A user to should be able to figure out how to use our application in under 5 minutes.  

## Test Suite — 
To test our application we have done numerous test ourselves throughout the course of the semester building Quest. As we have also learned, it is not good enough to test your own creations. Through the semester professor Vander Linden and our stakeholder have given us valuable feedback to help make our application more useable. We also conducted discount useaability test with the help of CS 108 students and our stakeholders. In these test we created a [test script](https://github.com/OperationBrokenWaterfall/materials/blob/master/usabilityTestScript.md) to give to the testers. The testers attempted to complete the tasks on the script, and talked out loud about their experience as they attempted to complete the tasks. If something was confuzing or a feature was missing, the testers let us know so that we could take note. If you would like to read a more comprehensive synopsis of what was found as a result of our user testing, so can read our final report [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1yDZVf3ELmPOaENYAyqaQt9waUNf_KM9OWlXKwVivjFI).

## The System — 
If you would like to run the Quest application on your Android phone, follow these simple steps:
1. First, install Android studio onto your computer for your specific system from [Here](https://developer.android.com/studio/gclid=Cj0KCQiAgMPgBRDDARIsAOh3uyIZQ042orRuSLQAxshK8L5OBVkSSbhUJVLc6CUVbcoB4Hx7G879gQsaAm-8EALw_wcB) 
2. Next, copy our repository url from [GitHub](https://github.com/OperationBrokenWaterfall/Quest.git)
3. Make sure that you have [GIT](https://git-scm.com/downloads) version control downloaded on your system.
4. Open your terminal in the directory where you want to store the application and type: git clone https://git-scm.com/downloads
5. After completing step 4 you will see your clone of the Quest application code. Open this project from within Android Studio. You can now run Quest on your device!
